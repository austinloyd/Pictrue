    <h3> August 13, 2020
    <p>Today is my birthday! And what a way to start my year. I recently got my class 10 marks. I scored well, enought to lift my parent's chins up.And its 2020 so it's lockdown. Well lockdown does suck as it bought sorrows to so any people and families, But Me being privilledged to be born in this family, was lucky and graced by god to not experience any of those tough days. For me, the lockdown was a positive. It did slowed down the pace of our lives which was nothing short of a rat race. It brought me real close to my parents. Kept my friends apart, Some left some stayed. It was a real litmus test and a lesson for life. That nothing is permanent.
Anyways, enough of philosophy, time for the adventure. It was just 12 AM and dad planned a trip for my birthday, it was a road trips. I love road trips. It was to start at 2:30 AM, We had a 4 hr drive to a beech. Then come back and have fun. Well for starters, i never slept that day. I was too gassed for the trip. I was the first person ready, we started the journey. It was arround 3 in the morning, 1 hr into the journey i was hungry, to my suprise there was a restaurant open at bloody 3 in the morning, great food tho. Loved it! Reached the beech in time to see the sunrise. Nothing can be more refreshing than a beech sunrise. I was taken a back for some time. It was like dropping ur heavy bags down on the ground after a long trek. That feeling still kicks me back to nostalgia. I went and burried my feet into the sand, and the waves greeted my presence. Nature is a wonderful thing. Probably the only good thing in this dying world. It gives us all waht we need. Both materialistic values and abstract pleasures. That day, since i was through a phase, it taught me a very important lesson. Life is like a beech. No matter how big of a castle u build on the beech, No matter how big ur footprints are on the shore, in the end the water takes it away. Everything we have, own or achieve, be it people, relationships, things, everything has its due date. Every new start has an end. Or else the life becomes undefinable and abstract. Our life on this world goes meaning less. No wonder mathematicians say anything raise to infinity = Not Definable. Im way too philosophical. Anyways, had fun at the beech, helped me connect to my inner peace and my spiritual side. Its good to be in touch with ur spiritual side. Helps u maintain a calm nerve. Came back home, had a lovely dinner, and charged all my batteries for the year.
